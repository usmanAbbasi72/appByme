## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey responsibility and trust, drawing inspiration from traditional banking aesthetics without being overly conservative.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F9FF), a desaturated version of the primary color that provides a calm, uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#A78BFA), an analogous color providing visual interest without overwhelming the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use dollar sign icons to represent incomes, and simple minus icons to represent outcome.
